# Values and standards

## **Pillars**

### **01 Meet science-based emissions targets**

The IPCC has called on all nations to reach peak carbon emissions by 2020, cut emissions by 45% by 2030, and reach zero emissions by 2050, in order to limit further global warming to 1.5 degrees C \([IPCC, 2018](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/sites/2/2019/05/SR15_SPM_version_report_LR.pdf)\). If the latter cannot be achieved, Singapore and the world will suffer dramatically higher risks of extreme weather, coastal flooding, and lack of food \([IPCC, 2018](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/sites/2/2019/05/SR15_SPM_version_report_LR.pdf)\). Singapore must recalibrate its Nationally Declared Contributions \(NDCs\) to the Paris Agreement to meet these targets as an example to the world. 

### **02 Price the social cost of carbon pollution**

Our current economic system does not account for the social cost of carbon emissions that falls on the environment and people that depend on living ecosystems.  We should correct this by setting the right price on carbon in line with IMF guidance and at the level that incentivises companies to switch to low carbon alternatives and stimulate new green growth investments -- at a minimum of USD $75/ton by 2030 and rising thereafter \([IMF, 2019](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/FM/Issues/2019/09/12/fiscal-monitor-october-2019)\).

### **03 Decarbonize our economy**

Publish a decarbonization masterplan which details the implementation of how to meet the scientific targets including the funding budget of expenditures, revenue sources and impact to stakeholders in business, households and international allies.  The masterplan is intended to be a state directed whole-of-government shift of the economic model away from high risk sunset industries and into new growth industries.

### **04 Ensure a just transition**

Provide direct support to the vulnerable to avoid the cost of inaction and to manage the cost of the transition.  Develop programs that offer social assistance and financial relief for the hardest hit workers and families with less adaptive capacity yet are exposed to sunset industries and cost of living during the transition period

### **05 Improve public welfare**

Deliver general social and economic improvements for households and workers in Singapore that enhance their quality of life.

### **06 Encourage public co-creation**

Pioneer policy building from the ground up where people can play a role in the writing of the policy.  To encourage direct public participation as a means of policy development and  representation at the policy making decision table.

### **07 Be a leader and team player in the region**

To be an exemplary leader in expanding integration of green policies in the region, strengthen economic and diplomatic ties with ASEAN neighbors and empower the more vulnerable with  direct support.

## **Values**

These are the values that motivate the standards of conduct and content for how the report is built.

### **01 Uphold the truth**

No matter how uncomfortable or what the consequences may be, we strive to defend and uphold the truth, even if it may come with a personal cost.  We do not self-censor and we do not intentionally give false testimony.  We defend the truth and when we find that we have made an error or there is a lack of clarity we continuously seek to improve clarity of the truth.  

### **02 Evidence-based**

The ultimate basis for determining truth is via the skeptical process of the scientific method which is founded on among other things empirical observations and measurement, systematic rules of logic, refutable hypothesis, self criticism, identification and mitigation of bias, builds on prior scientific knowledge and discovery via trial and experimentation.  We proactively seek out to educate ourselves and close gaps in our own knowledge through our research.  Claims that we present to ourselves and the public must be defensible if we are to have credibility and influence.  We do not bluff and are value tracing our decisions to their underlying assumptions.

### **03 Universal rights and freedoms**

All people of the world both current and future generations share a common right to life, justice, peace and freedom of speech as defined in the articles of the [Universal Declaration of Human Rights](https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/)

### **04 Serve others**

We put others' needs ahead of our own.  We safeguard the basic rights of all humans, to preserve the life bearing capacity of the planet’s ecological systems and to intervene in case of any threat to either of these.  We aim to deliver a product to the greater public, and seek open channels for co-creation so that we can achieve maximum impact reach and that others can benefit from the work we do. Through the course of our efforts to achieve our mission we must avoid causing a situation that would risk resulting in an overall worse welfare for others.

### **05 Transparency**

We are open about our intentions and our processes, and where we are in error we own them and respond to resolve them.  We actively monitor and cross-check our work to find gaps and inconsistencies so that we are able to attest to the quality and integrity of our output.

### **06 Adaptable with an open mind**

Agility, flexibility and creativity help our team to respond dynamically, and allows a more welcoming space for a diverse range of members.  Being flexible and willing to try new things can also be a positive experience for us as individuals as well.  If someone suggests something new, be willing to give it a try. We practice taking multiple perspectives to gain a more complete understanding of our world, and opens up more doors and possibilities.

### **07 Embrace diversity and respect others**

We value diversity and respect everyone as individuals for who they are regardless of their race, religion, sex, gender or other identity.  We respect individuals' right to opinion and beliefs and autonomy to the extent that they do not harm or limit someone else’s rights.
